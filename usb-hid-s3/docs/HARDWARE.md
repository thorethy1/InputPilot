## What you need

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| ESP32-S3-Zero/Mini board | Above |
| USB-C data cable | Charge-only cables will not enumerate |
| Host PC | USB HID target (mouse/keyboard appear here) |
| Optional: phone/PC on WiFi | Soft-AP setup or STA REST control |

## Flash procedure (USB-OTG)

Auto-reset into download mode usually **fails** in native USB-OTG mode:

1. Hold **BOOT**, tap **RESET**, release **BOOT** (or unplug → hold BOOT →
   replug → release BOOT).
2. Upload firmware (`pio run -e esp32s3 -t upload` or `./scripts/deploy.sh`).
3. **Power-cycle** the board (unplug/replug) so the app boots in OTG mode.

After power-cycle the host should see USB identity **VID `0xCAFE` / PID `0x4001`**
(“S3 Mouse+Keyboard”), not Espressif’s JTAG CDC (`0x303A`).

`scripts/flash_and_verify.sh` waits for that enumeration after you power-cycle.

| Dim solid green | STA up, jiggle off |
| Cyan breathing | STA up, jiggle on |
